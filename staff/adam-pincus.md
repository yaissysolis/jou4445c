# Adam Pincus

From Miami, Fla.

I am in the class, because I am interested in pursuing a career in magazine publishing. I worked this past summer with Field & Stream through the American Society of Magazine Editors' internship program. I plan on moving to New York following graduation. Hopefully, the skills I gain from Applied Magazines will help get me a job!
